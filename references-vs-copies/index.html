    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2);
    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2);  // changing original one will not update the second one

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const teams = players;
    console.log(players, teams);
    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    teams[3] = 'Lux';

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    console.log(players);
    console.log(teams);
    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice();
    
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    team5[3] = 'CR7'
    console.log(team4);
    console.log(team5);
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    //const captain = person;
    //captain.age = 99;
    //console.log(person);
    //console.log(captain);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const captain = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 10});
    captain.age = 99;
    console.log(person);
    console.log(captain);
    
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap2 = {...person};
    cap2.age = 100;
    console.log(cap2);
    console.log(person);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
